Introducing my first Shiny App
========================================================

Started with the cool tabbed panels shiny app from

http://shiny.rstudio.com/tutorial/lesson1/
     runExample("06_tabsets") # tabbed panels

Then added:


- interactive caption
- mean and median calculated for the distibution
- colored plot lines for mean and median on the histogram
- Adding text for mean and median values on the histogram

Shiny any deployed on Shinyapps.io
========================================================

Presentation Challenges with Shiny aps 
========================================================

Tried unsuccessfully to integrate my Shiny Ap into Slidify or R presentation

Partial results are here for the slidify attempt:
https://ccmyers.shinyapps.io/slidifyprenstation/
Sliderinput not recognized, and could not get main plot area working either

Not able to even get partial results using R presentation.


Summary 
========================================================

Shiny apps are pretty cool, and easy to update given the examples and tutorials!

Slidify looks promising, but needs more time before I can learn how to get all shiny widgets working.

Also noticed that sometimes only Google Chrome displayed presentation correctly instead of Internet Explorer

Or I may have to learn html :-)

Or next time do a more simple shiny ap for my presentation example ??
